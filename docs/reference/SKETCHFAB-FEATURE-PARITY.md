## Adding New Dependencies

The project uses **Vite + npm**. New Three.js addons and packages are added via `npm install` and imported normally — no import map changes required.

```bash
npm install some-package
```

```typescript
import { SSAOPass } from 'three/addons/postprocessing/SSAOPass.js';
```

**Kiosk mode** now uses the same Vite build pipeline as the editor (separate entry points). New dependencies imported via npm are automatically bundled into both the kiosk and editor builds — no separate CDN step required.

> **Note:** The downloadable offline kiosk HTML generator (`kiosk-viewer.ts`) is deprecated. Its `CDN_DEPS` object is no longer the mechanism for adding kiosk dependencies.

---

## Key Architectural Considerations

1. **Post-processing pipeline**: Introducing `EffectComposer` changes the render loop from `renderer.render(scene, camera)` to `composer.render()`. This affects the dual-canvas split view and kiosk mode. Plan this carefully.

2. **Kiosk mode**: The kiosk is now a separate Vite bundle served at `/`. New dependencies are bundled automatically. HDR environment textures could add significant bulk — consider low-res HDR (512x256) for kiosk or making environments optional.

3. **Gaussian splat compatibility**: Spark.js renders splats in its own pass. Post-processing effects (SSAO, bloom) may not apply to splats correctly. Test early.

4. **Performance budget**: SSAO + bloom together cost ~30% FPS. Add quality presets (Low/Medium/High) that toggle expensive effects.

5. **Build pipeline via Vite**: Three.js addons can be imported directly from npm (`three/addons/...`). Both the kiosk and editor bundles are built by Vite — no separate CDN fetching step. The downloadable kiosk HTML generator is deprecated.
